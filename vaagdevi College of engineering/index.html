                    <p>National Cadet Corps at Vaagdevi College of Engineering was raised in the month of November 2010 under the affiliation of 1(A) Compo(Tech) Regt NCC, Warangal Group. Now it is known as 1(T) Compo (Tech) Regt NCC with a strength of 100 cadets (Company). All the Boys and Girls of B.Tech I year and II Year of our autonomous college in Warangal can enroll if they possess the required eligibility criteria specified in the NCC Act. The cadets joined into NCC are required to follow the rules and regulations specified in the NCC Act. The boy cadets are enrolled into Senior Division (SD) and the girl cadets enrolled into Senior Wing (SW). In the year 2010, Vaagdevi College of Engineering enrolled cadets into SD only, from 2011 onwards we are enrolling the cadets into both SD & SW. NCC imparts the military training to cadets through which the students get the awareness about the forces. The training will be conducted in two ways viz., Institutional training & Camp training. Our engineering & pg college in Warangal is conducting NCC activities very successfully by encouraging the cadets to take part in the uniform services and other government services to serve the society directly or indirectly. Our VCE college cadets received the best cadet awards and scholarships at the Directorate and Group level and had representation to prestigious Republic Day Camp also.</p>

                            <p>As the chairman, I am happy that most of our students who passed out from this institute have been very well placed both in India and outside in the organizations of their choice and some of them have even started their own ventures. We feel happy that our students have spread far and wide globally and many have excelled as academicians, administrators, executives and professionals, yet our efforts will go and forever in ensuring them a bright and wonderful career to prove to the world that they are the fittest ones to survive in the global competition successfully.
